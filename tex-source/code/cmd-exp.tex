<enum name="MAV_CMD">
    <description>Commands to be executed by the MAV. They can be executed on user 
                request, or as part of a mission script. If the action is used in 
                a mission, the parameter mapping to the waypoint/mission message is 
                as follows: Param 1, Param 2, Param 3, Param 4, X: Param 5, Y:Param 6,
                Z:Param 7. This command list is similar what ARINC 424 is for 
                commercial aircraft: A data format how to interpret waypoint/mission
                data.</description>
